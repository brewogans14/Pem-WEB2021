            <h3>A drone is an unmanned aircraft. Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems. Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software-controlled flight plans in its embedded systems, that work in conjunction with onboard sensors and a global positioning system (GPS).
              UAVs were most often associated with the military. They were initially used for anti-aircraft target practice, intelligence gathering and, more controversially, as weapons platforms. Drones are now also used in a range of civilian roles, including the following:</h3>

            <h2>DJI</h2>
            <h3>SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. or Shenzhen DJI Sciences and Technologies Ltd.</h3>
            <h3>(深圳大疆创新科技有限公司)</h3>
            <h4>Is a Chinese technology company headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, with manufacturing facilities throughout the world. DJI manufactures commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for aerial photography and videography. It also designs and manufactures camera gimbals, action cameras, camera stabilizers, flight platforms, propulsion systems and flight control systems.</h4>
            <h4>In November 2015, DJI announced the establishment of a strategic partnership with Hasselblad.In January 2019, DJI acquired a majority stake in Hasselblad.
              DJI accounts for around 70% of the world's consumer drone market as of March 2020, with no other company accounting for more than 5%. Its camera drone technology is widely used in the music, television and film industries. The company's products have also been used by militaries and police forces, as well as terrorist groups, with the company taking steps to limit access to the latter. Some US government institutions have issued statements discouraging their internal use of DJI products, but as of 2020, various agencies at the local and federal level continue to use DJI products.</h4>
